# Flash_Card_App
A flash card application designed for language education.
A flashcard application I developed using Python and the Tkinter library, showcasing my proficiency in GUI development and data manipulation. This application allows users to learn and test their knowledge of French words in an interactive and visually appealing manner. The code utilizes pandas to load and manage the flashcard data from a CSV file, ensuring a seamless learning experience. With a sleek user interface and intuitive functionality, the application randomly presents flashcards with French words, enabling users to flip the card to reveal the corresponding English translation. The 'right' and 'wrong' buttons provide a simple way for users to indicate their knowledge of the word, dynamically updating the displayed flashcards accordingly. Through the implementation of timers and event-driven programming, the application ensures a smooth and engaging learning process. This project demonstrates my expertise in Python programming, GUI development, data manipulation, and user-centric design. It also reflects my ability to deliver effective and interactive solutions for educational purposes.
